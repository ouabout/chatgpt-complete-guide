# ChatGPT Complete Guide
This tiny place of the Web stores a growing collection of interesting things
about [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and GPT-3 from OpenAI.

I want an all-in-one place to keep things about ChatGPT. So, I hand-curated this
list with the help of others (acknowleged below).

The collections are not limited to only the best resources, tools, examples,
demos, hacks, apps, and usages of ChatGPT.

<!-- my personal brain dumps? -->

---

The following resources started off based on awesome-chatgpt lists[^1][^2] but with my
own modifications:

## General Resources

- [ChatGPT launch blog post](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)
- [ChatGPT official app](https://chat.openai.com)
- [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) - a pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT.
- [Official ChatGPT and Whisper APIs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis) - Developers can now integrate ChatGPT models into their apps and products through the API.
    > Model: The ChatGPT model family we are releasing today, **`gpt-3.5-turbo`, is the same model used in the ChatGPT** product. It is **priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens, which is 10x cheaper than our existing GPT-3.5 models**.
    >
    > API: Traditionally, GPT models consume unstructured text, which is represented to the model as a sequence of ‚Äútokens.‚Äù ChatGPT models instead consume a sequence of messages together with metadata.

Principle 1 means LLMs trained to predict words get lower loss if they can simulate planning abilities.

## Prompting (Prompt Programming[^5])*

According to Gwern:
> A new programming paradigm? You interact with it, expressing any task in terms of natural language descriptions, requests, and examples, tweaking the prompt until it "understands" & it meta-learns the new task. This is a rather different way of using a model, and it's better to think of it as a new kind of programming, **prompt programming**, where the prompt is now a coding language which programs GPT-3 to do new things.

"Prompting" as an engineering discipline is not here to stay. It's a temporary crutch on the way to natural language interfaces. ChatGPT solves a big portion of the prompting problem. Adding engineering to a term to amplify its perceived importance or difficulty might be unnecessary. We could probably call it "prompt testing/hacking" and not lose any of the meaning.

[^4]: A key component of GPT-3.5 models are Books1 and Books2.
      [Books1](https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus/issues/27#issuecomment-716104208) - aka BookCorpus, a free books scraped from smashwords.com.
      Books2 - We know very little about what this is, people suspect it's libgen, but it's purely conjecture.
      Nonetheless, books3 is "all of bibliotik".

### Open Source ChatGPT

We want a ChatGPT alternative like Stable Diffusion.

Frustrated by all the gatekeeping around AI? Still waiting or cannot get access to LLaMA? <!-- LLaMA is for research only and has a restrictive license (not for commercial use). AI is fundamentally entrenched in gatekeeping. Still remember Kaggle winners keeping their model to themselves? Unpopular opinon: until engineers can read and understand the latest research papers, we won't be there. -->

**Goals**

- Open source effort towards OpenAI's ChatGPT.
- Reverse engineer and replicate ChatGPT models and training data.
- Truly open models. 100% non-profit. 100% free.

**Ultimate goal:** self-hosted version of ChatGPT.

**Lessons**

Takeaways from [EleutherAI one year retro (2021)](https://blog.eleuther.ai/year-one/):
- Access to enough compute/hardware/GPU alone won't help you succeed. You need:
  - a proper dataset (beyond the Pile and [c4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4))
  - research expertise
  - engineering capabilities
  - a lot of hard work
<!-- Long version: even if you throw money or free credits for Cloud compute it will not be enough.
We've seen this happen with EleutherAI who were not capable of reaching their initial target of "replicating" GPT-3 and 
could only deliver the GPT-NeoX 20B model despite all the free compute, etc.-->

#### Projects

- [FLAN-T5 XXL](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) aka. ChatGPT@Home is a public model that has undergone instruction finetuning. XXL is a 11B model. It is currently the most comparable model against ChatGPT (InstructGPT models are initialized from GPT-3.x series ([model card](https://github.com/openai/following-instructions-human-feedback/blob/main/model-card.md))). There are successful attempts deploying FLAN-T5 on GPU with 24 GB RAM with [bitsandbytes-Int8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JxSo4lQgMDBdnd19VBEoaG-mMfQupQ3XvOrgmRAVtpU/edit) inference for Hugging Face models. You can run the model easily on a single machine, without performance degradation. This could be a game changer in enabling people outside of big tech companies being able to use these LLMs. Efforts are already underway to create a better FLAN-T5. The community (i.e., LAION) are working on FlanT5-Atlas architecture and a collection of prompted/instructions datasets.
  - [Fine-tuning GPT-J-6B in Colab: 8-bit weights with low-rank adaptors (LORA)](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/14839). ([Quantized EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b model with 8-bit weights](https://huggingface.co/hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit))
    - How many GPU and how much VRAM is required to run the model? Around 175GB or ~8x 24GB consumer GPUs. Details: [A Gentle Introduction to 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for transformers at scale using Hugging Face Transformers, Accelerate and bitsandbytes](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)
  - Why FLAN-T5? They are more aligned than other LLM because it's already been finetuned with instructions. Furthermore, the largest version, [11B can run on a single NVIDIA T4](https://www.philschmid.de/deploy-t5-11b).
  - Accelerating deep learning computing ‚Äî efficient training, efficient inference (deployment), data/memory efficient models, and compression (efficient architectures).
    - Apply compression techniques like quantization from my [Awesome ML model compression](https://github.com/cedrickchee/awesome-ml-model-compression#quantization) project.

- [Open-Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Chat-GPT) - Open-source ChatGPT replication by LAION, Yannic Kilcher et al. This project is meant to give everyone access to a great chat based large language model. ([Open Assistant Live Coding with Yannic Kilcher (video)](https://youtu.be/sswA4j_IUxg)) High-level plans:

  > **Phase 1:** Prompt collection for supervised finetuning (SFT) and to get the prompts for model generated completions/answers.
  >
  > **Phase 2:** Human feedback (e.g. ranking) of multiple outputs generated by the model. Example five model outputs are shown and the user should rank them from best to worst.
  >
  > **Phase 3:** Optimization with RLHF which we plan to do via TRLX. And then the we iterate with this new model again over phase 2 and phase 3 hopefully multiple times.
  
  Models will be trained on Summit supercomputer (~6 million NVIDIA V100 hrs per year) [[source](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R7OHgW-KOXNia4z5_rBwZj_ecSf6TqzG/view)]
  
  More info, see the LAION LLM proposal (Google Doc) above.
  
  **Progress:**
  
  - Feb 2023: [Joi-20B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/Rallio67/joi_20B_instruct_alpha) is a 20B model fine-tuned on [a diverse set of instruction datasets](https://github.com/Rallio67/language-model-agents) and based on NeoX-20B.
  
    _**Unofficial:** This is an early pre-release model (part of development of MVP, phase 1), not directly OpenAssistant (OA) models.
  They are experiments by the ML team to learn what data, foundation model, methods will work well for OA.
  As is stated in the website's FAQ, no demo yet.
  This is for developers to test out early development version of instruction tuning for the model. Maybe first OA models will be derived from these.
  They have been training good models on a rolling basis as new datasets get completed.
  There are a variety of model sizes from 1.4B to 20B params available on the HF Hub._
 
    [Chatty-LMS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/chatty-lms) build by HuggingFace H4 team - A UI for testing Joi-20B-instruct model. You can chat with it. The agent will reply as Joi (the [bot nickname](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/blob/main/model/model_training/tools/model_chat.py#LL15C56-L15C56)). <!-- I guess the name is loosely inspired by a friendly fictional AI in the movies? -->

    Example of code snippet to run the model on your own GPUs: https://gist.github.com/cedrickchee/236e53ed2dca95bd96e5baa35cdd7be2

- [CarperAI/TRLX](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx)
  - Originated as a fork of [TRL](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl).
  - It allows you to fine-tune Hugging Face language models (GPT2, GPT-NeoX based) up to 20B parameters using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
  - Brought to you by CarperAI (an EleutherAI lab). They have [announced plans for the first open-source "instruction-tuned" LM](https://carper.ai/instruct-gpt-announcement/). CarperAI started by developing production ready open-source RLHF tools. [[Tweet and video](https://twitter.com/ZetaVector/status/1604842914835828736)]
  
  News (2023-01-13): They replicated OpenAI's _Learning to Summarize_ paper using trlX library. [[report](https://wandb.ai/carperai/summarize_RLHF/reports/Implementing-RLHF-Learning-to-Summarize-with-trlX--VmlldzozMzAwODM2)]
  
- [lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch) - (WIP) Implementation of RLHF on top of the PaLM architecture. Basically ChatGPT but with PaLM. The developer plan to add retrieval functionality too, √† la RETRO. [[Tweet](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1608143718460055552)] <!-- On 2022-12-29, "First open source ChatGPT has arrived". This is unncessary hype. The released code is just the model, no weights, no datasets used to trained the model, no inference model for deployment, no conversational UI/Web. A lot of things are not ready. This is far from calling it the "first" open source ChatGPT. People are getting ahead of themselves. -->
